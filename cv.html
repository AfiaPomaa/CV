        <b class="highlight">Be Obsessed with Safety and Risk</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a Student Border Service Officer,
        I was obsessed with safety and risk at every step.
        When training for weapon handling,
        I recognized that I was having difficulty catching
        on to the arrest techniques, I scheduled extra time
        with the CBSA trainer.
        By arriving an hour before everyone, I got some
        extra practice and became better prepared for in airport
        safety protocols.

      <p class="thing">
        <b class="highlight">Open and Transparent Dialogue</b>
      </p>
      <p>My most recent experience as a residence 
        assistance required open and transparent 
        dialogue at every stage.  I was the first point of 
        contact for 44 students, I was the support for the 
        students on your floor. In order to efficiently 
        support students, I needed to create a relationship with them from the get go,
         so that they would feel comfortbale coming to me in times of crisis. I did this by doing a door to door snack delivery in the first week to introduce myself. 
          I was also responsible
         for organizing weekly events, creating posters,
         liaison with my students, managers and co-workers. 
         This required transparent dialogue with my team both during planning and the execution of events.

          Empowerment with Accountability
           and Performance Management 
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I developed people through empowerment
         by keeping up with weekly check-ins. 
         I managed their performance by keeping a 
         record of their mental and academic status
          as was reported during the weekly meetings.
           With this technique, I was able to keep them
            accountable by reminding them of the goals
             they set for themselves
         and shared with me in the beginning of the semester.

          Take Ownership for the Whole-

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I took ownership for the whole by learning 
        HTML and CSS as soon as I found out 2 days 
        ago that I was placed on the digital team. 
        Knowing that I do not have a digital background, 
        I decided to apply myself and learn what I can
         as I know I will improve together with the
         team as I continue to gain more experience in the role.

              As a Co-President of the African Students‚Äô
               Association, I noticed that our event attendants
                did not represent the bulk of the continent 
                despite our diverse social media following.  I immediately sent out a survey though Instagram, 
                Facebook and email to test the reasons why that may be so, in order 
              to implement a new strategy to engage the student union.
